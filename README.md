## Imagen - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://gweb-research-imagen.appspot.com/">Imagen</a>, Google's Text-to-Image Neural Network that beats DALL-E2, in Pytorch. It is the new SOTA for text-to-image synthesis.

Architecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.

It appears neither CLIP nor prior network is needed after all. And so research continues.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install imagen-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen

# unet for imagen

unet1 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = 3,
    layer_attns = (False, True, True, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, True, True, True)
)

unet2 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8, 8),
    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, False, True)
)

# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)

imagen = Imagen(
    unets = (unet1, unet2),
    image_sizes = (64, 256),
    timesteps = 1000,
    cond_drop_prob = 0.1
).cuda()

# mock images (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5

text_embeds = torch.randn(4, 256, 768).cuda()
text_masks = torch.ones(4, 256).bool().cuda()
images = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade

for i in (1, 2):
    loss = imagen(images, text_embeds = text_embeds, text_masks = text_masks, unet_number = i)
    loss.backward()

# do the above for many many many many steps
# now you can sample an image based on the text embeddings from the cascading ddpm

images = imagen.sample(texts = [
    'a whale breaching from afar',
    'young girl blowing out candles on her birthday cake',
    'fireworks with blue and green sparkles'
], cond_scale = 3.)

images.shape # (3, 3, 256, 256)
```

For simpler training, you can directly supply text strings instead of precomputing text encodings. (Although for scaling purposes, you will definitely want to precompute the textual embeddings + mask)

The number of textual captions must match the batch size of the images if you go this route.

```python
# mock images and text (get a lot of this)

texts = [
    'a child screaming at finding a worm within a half-eaten apple',
    'lizard running across the desert on two feet',
    'waking up to a psychedelic landscape',
    'seashells sparkling in the shallow waters'
]

images = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade

for i in (1, 2):
    loss = imagen(images, texts = texts, unet_number = i)
    loss.backward()
```

With the `ImagenTrainer` wrapper class, the exponential moving averages for all of the U-nets in the cascading DDPM will be automatically taken care of when calling `update`

```python
import torch
from imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen, ImagenTrainer

# unet for imagen

unet1 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = 3,
    layer_attns = (False, True, True, True),
)

unet2 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    cond_dim = 512,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8, 8),
    layer_attns = (False, False, False, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, False, True)
)

# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)

imagen = Imagen(
    unets = (unet1, unet2),
    text_encoder_name = 't5-large',
    image_sizes = (64, 256),
    timesteps = 1000,
    cond_drop_prob = 0.1
).cuda()

# wrap imagen with the trainer class

trainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen)

# mock images (get a lot of this) and text encodings from large T5

text_embeds = torch.randn(64, 256, 1024).cuda()
text_masks = torch.ones(64, 256).bool().cuda()
images = torch.randn(64, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# feed images into imagen, training each unet in the cascade

for i in (1, 2):
    loss = trainer(
        images,
        text_embeds = text_embeds,
        text_masks = text_masks,
        unet_number = i,
        max_batch_size = 4        # auto divide the batch of 64 up into batch size of 4 and accumulate gradients, so it all fits in memory
    )

    trainer.update(unet_number = i)

# do the above for many many many many steps
# now you can sample an image based on the text embeddings from the cascading ddpm

images = trainer.sample(texts = [
    'a puppy looking anxiously at a giant donut on the table',
    'the milky way galaxy in the style of monet'
], cond_scale = 3.)

images.shape # (2, 3, 256, 256)
```

You can also train Imagen without text (unconditional image generation) as follows

```python
import torch
from imagen_pytorch import Unet, Imagen, SRUnet256, ImagenTrainer

# unets for unconditional imagen

unet1 = Unet(
    dim = 32,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4),
    num_resnet_blocks = 3,
    layer_attns = (False, True, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, True, True),
    use_linear_attn = True
)

unet2 = SRUnet256(
    dim = 32,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4),
    num_resnet_blocks = (2, 4, 8),
    layer_attns = (False, False, True),
    layer_cross_attns = (False, False, True)
)

# imagen, which contains the unets above (base unet and super resoluting ones)

imagen = Imagen(
    condition_on_text = False,   # this must be set to False for unconditional Imagen
    unets = (unet1, unet2),
    image_sizes = (64, 128),
    timesteps = 1000
)

trainer = ImagenTrainer(imagen).cuda()

# now get a ton of images and feed it through the Imagen trainer

training_images = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# train each unet in concert, or separately (recommended) to completion

for u in (1, 2):
    loss = trainer(training_images, unet_number = u)
    trainer.update(unet_number = u)

# do the above for many many many many steps
# now you can sample images unconditionally from the cascading unet(s)

images = trainer.sample(batch_size = 16) # (16, 3, 128, 128)
```

## Experimental

<a href="https://research.nvidia.com/person/tero-karras">Tero Karras</a> of StyleGAN fame has written a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364">new paper</a> with results that have been corroborated by a number of independent researchers as well as on my own machine. I have decided to create a version of `Imagen`, the `ElucidatedImagen`, so that one can use the new elucidated DDPM for text-guided cascading generation.

Simply import `ElucidatedImagen`, and then instantiate the instance as you did before. The hyperparameters are different than the usual ones for discrete and continuous time gaussian diffusion, and can be individualized for each unet in the cascade.

Ex.

```python

imagen = ElucidatedImagen(
    unets = (unet1, unet2),
    image_sizes = (64, 128),
    cond_drop_prob = 0.1,
    sigma_min = 0.002,           # min noise level
    sigma_max = (80, 160),       # max noise level, @crowsonkb recommends double the max noise level for upsampler
    sigma_data = 0.5,            # standard deviation of data distribution
    rho = 7,                     # controls the sampling schedule
    P_mean = -1.2,               # mean of log-normal distribution from which noise is drawn for training
    P_std = 1.2,                 # standard deviation of log-normal distribution from which noise is drawn for training
    S_churn = 80,                # parameters for stochastic sampling - depends on dataset, Table 5 in apper
    S_tmin = 0.05,
    S_tmax = 50,
    S_noise = 1.003,
).cuda()

```

## FAQ

- Why are my generated images not aligning well with the text?

Imagen uses an algorithm called <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=qw8AKxfYbI">Classifier Free Guidance</a>. When sampling, you apply a scale to the conditioning (text in this case) of greater than `1.0`.

Researcher <a href="https://github.com/Netruk44 ">Netruk44</a> have reported `5-10` to be optimal, but anything greater than `10` to break.

```python
trainer.sample(texts = [
    'a cloud in the shape of a roman gladiator'
], cond_scale = 5.) # <-- cond_scale is the conditioning scale, needs to be greater than 1.0 to be better than average
```

- Are there any pretrained models yet?

Not at the moment but one will likely be trained and open sourced within the year, if not sooner. If you would like to participate, you can join the community of artificial neural network trainers at Laion (discord link is in the Readme above) and start collaborating.

## Todo

- [x] use huggingface transformers for T5-small text embeddings
- [x] add dynamic thresholding
- [x] add dynamic thresholding DALLE2 and video-diffusion repository as well
- [x] allow for one to set T5-large (and perhaps small factory method to take in any huggingface transformer)
- [x] add the lowres noise level with the pseudocode in appendix, and figure out what is this sweep they do at inference time
- [x] port over some training code from DALLE2
- [x] need to be able to use a different noise schedule per unet (cosine was used for base, but linear for SR)
- [x] just make one master-configurable unet
- [x] complete resnet block (biggan inspired? but with groupnorm) - complete self attention
- [x] complete conditioning embedding block (and make it completely configurable, whether it be attention, film etc)
- [x] consider using perceiver-resampler from https://github.com/lucidrains/flamingo-pytorch in place of attention pooling
- [x] add attention pooling option, in addition to cross attention and film
- [x] add optional cosine decay schedule with warmup, for each unet, to trainer
- [x] switch to continuous timesteps instead of discretized, as it seems that is what they used for all stages - first figure out the linear noise schedule case from the variational ddpm paper https://openreview.net/forum?id=2LdBqxc1Yv
- [x] figure out log(snr) for alpha cosine noise schedule.
- [x] suppress the transformers warning because only T5encoder is used
- [x] allow setting for using linear attention on layers where full attention cannot be used
- [x] force unets in continuous time case to use non-fouriered conditions (just pass the log(snr) through an MLP with optional layernorms), as that is what i have working locally
- [x] removed learned variance
- [x] add p2 loss weighting for continuous time
- [x] make sure cascading ddpm can be trained without text condition, and make sure both continuous and discrete time gaussian diffusion works
- [x] use primer's depthwise convs on the qkv projections in linear attention (or use token shifting before projections) - also use new dropout proposed by bayesformer, as it seems to work well with linear attention
- [x] explore skip layer excitation in unet decoder
- [ ] pytorch lightning integration
- [ ] preencoding of text to memmapped embeddings
- [ ] build out CLI tool for training, resuming training, and one-line generation of image
- [ ] extend to video generation, using axial time attention as in Ho's video ddpm paper + https://github.com/lucidrains/flexible-diffusion-modeling-videos-pytorch for up to 25 minute video
- [ ] add inpainting ability using resampler from repaint paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09865
- [ ] consider unet with attention mediating skip connections https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04335
